# Neural Signal Classification System

## Overview
This project is a Neural Signal Classification System that leverages AI to classify simulated neural signals, representing different brain states (e.g., rest, movement intention, visual stimulus). The system generates synthetic neural data, preprocesses it, trains a Random Forest Classifier, and visualizes the results. It demonstrates skills in AI, signal processing, and data analysis, suitable for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) or neuroscience research.

## Features
Synthetic Neural Data Generation: Creates neural signals with distinct frequency characteristics for different brain states.
AI Classification: Employs a Random Forest Classifier to categorize signals into three classes (Rest, Movement, Visual).
Data Visualization: Plots sample neural signals to highlight differences between brain states.
Modular Code: Designed for easy extension to real neural datasets or advanced AI models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- joblib



## Installation



Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


## Install Dependencies:
python -m pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn scipy joblib




## Usage

Run the Script:

Execute the main script to generate data, train the model, and visualize results:python NeuralSignalClassifier.py


This will:
Generate 1000 synthetic neural signal samples with 64 features.
Train a Random Forest Classifier.
Display classification accuracy and a detailed report.
Plot sample signals for each brain state.




## Output:

A plot showing sample neural signals for Rest, Movement, and Visual states.
Console output with model accuracy and classification metrics.
A saved model file (neural_signal_classifier.pkl) for future use.


## Extend the Project:

Replace synthetic data with real neural datasets (e.g., EEG from PhysioNet or Kaggle).
Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., LSTM or CNN) using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Add real-time data processing with Pythonâ€™s socket library to simulate live BCI applications.
